# Facial Expressions Recognition
Project Description: This project aims to develop a system that can detect and analyze facial expressions using computer vision technologies. The system is designed to have the ability to classify people's emotional states based on their facial expressions.

Inputs: The inputs to be used in the project are photographs of human faces reflecting various emotional states. These photos will be close-ups where facial expressions can be clearly seen.

Outputs: The system will analyze the facial photographs given as input and classify the emotional state they reflect (happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, disgust and neutral). Each facial expression will be labeled as corresponding to one of these emotional states.

Classes: With the computer vision technologies to be developed, facial expressions will be divided into seven basic emotional state classes: Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Neutral. This classification will be an important step in understanding and accurately interpreting people's emotional states.
